What are you being asked to do?\n\n\n2.   What are the ethical implications of the model? What are the consequences of your model making errors?\n  *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false negative (i.e., when the model says a customer will give a tip, but they actually won't)?\n  \n  *   What is the likely effect of the model when it predicts a false positive (i.e., when the model says a customer will not give a tip, but they actually will)?  \n  \n  \n3.   Do the benefits of such a model outweigh the potential problems?\n  \n4.   Would you proceed with the request to build this model? Why or why not?\n \n5.   Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?\n\n\n**Question 1:**\n\nPredict if a customer will **not** leave a tip.\n\n**Question 2:**\n\nDrivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app.\nDrivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\nIt's not good to disincentivize drivers from picking up customers. It could also cause a customer backlash. The problems seem to outweigh the benefits.\n\n**Question 4:**\n\nNo. Effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.\n\n**Question 5:**\n\nWe can build a model that predicts the most generous customers. This could accomplish the goal of helping taxi drivers increase their earnings from tips while preventing the wrongful exclusion of certain people from using taxis.","metadata":{"id":"E5g1A74r0ow_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Suppose you were to modify the modeling objective so, instead of predicting people who won't tip at all, you predicted people who are particularly generous&mdash;those who will tip 20% or more?

We'd also want times, dates, and locations of both pickups and dropoffs, estimated fares, and payment method.\n\n**Question 2:**  What would be the target variable?\n\n\nThe target variable would be a binary variable (1 or 0) that indicates whether or not the customer is expected to tip ≥ 20%.\n\n**Question 3:**  \n\nThis is a supervised learning, classification task. We could use accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, area under the ROC curve, or a number of other metrics. However, we don't have enough information at this time to know which are most appropriate.

Computers make their calculations using floating-point arithmetic (hence the word \"float\"). Floating-point arithmetic is a system that allows computers to express both very large numbers and very small numbers with a high degree of precision, encoded in binary. However, precision is limited by the number of bits used to represent a number, which is generally 32 or 64, depending on the capabilities of your operating system. \n\nThis comes with limitations in that sometimes calculations that should result in clean, precise values end up being encoded as very long decimals.

It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n\n2. **What was your highest scoring model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \nUnfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.\n\n3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \nThere are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n\n\n$$round5\\_ratio = \\frac{amount\\ of\\ money\\ from\\ the\\ fare\\ amount\\ to\\ the\\ nearest\\ higher\\ multiple\\ of\\ $5}{fare\\ amount}$$   \n\n\n  $$ = \\frac{5 - (fare\\ mod\\ 5)}{fare\\ amount}$$  \n\n\n\n4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \nIt would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\nIt would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination.\n\n\nRemember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders?","metadata":{"id":"ill21hQ4ej9-"}}]}
