    "You are a data professional in a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.\n"

Floating-point arithmetic is a system that allows computers to express both very large numbers and very small numbers with a high degree of precision, encoded in binary. However, precision is limited by the number of bits used to represent a number, which is generally 32 or 64, depending on the capabilities of your operating system. \n",

    "**Response:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of using multiple models to predict on the test data is that you can compare models using data that was not used to train/tune hyperparameters. This reduces the risk of selecting a model based on how well it fit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of using the final test data to select a model is that, by using the unseen data to make a decision about which model to use, you no longer have a truly unbiased idea of how your model would be expected to perform on new data. In this case, think of final model selection as another way of \"tuning\" your model."

    "**Response:** The model is almost twice as likely to predict a false positive than it is to predict a false negative. Therefore, type I errors are more common. This is less desirable, because it's better for a driver to be pleasantly surprised by a generous tip when they weren't expecting one than to be disappointed by a low tip when they were expecting a generous one. However, the overall performance of this model is satisfactory. "

    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responses:**\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F<sub>1</sub> score was 0.7235 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.6865. It correctly identified ~78% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 48% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your highest scoring model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. We know that `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but we don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In our case, we could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. We could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of $5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. We could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$round5\\_ratio = \\frac{amount\\ of\\ money\\ from\\ the\\ fare\\ amount\\ to\\ the\\ nearest\\ higher\\ multiple\\ of\\ $5}{fare\\ amount}$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ = \\frac{5 - (fare\\ mod\\ 5)}{fare\\ amount}$$  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**   \n",
    "It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\n",
    "It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, we could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? What insights can you report back to stakeholders?"
