Understanding data\n\nIn this kernel, I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. This notebook will help ensure the information is:\n\n1.   Ready to answer questions and yield insights\n\n2.   Ready for visualizations\n\n3.   Ready for future hypothesis testing and statistical methods\n<br/>   \n\n**The purpose** of this notebook is to investigate and understand the data provided.\n  \n**The goal** is to use a dataframe contructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform of my findings. \n<br/>  \n*This activity has three parts:*\n\n**Part 1:** Understand the situation \n* Prepare to understand and organize the provided taxi cab dataset and information.\n\n**Part 2:** Understand the data\n\n* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.\n\n* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps.\n\n**Part 3:** Understand the variables\n\n* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.\n\n## 1. Understand the situation \n\nOne can prepare to understand the information by reading the taxi cab data fields and understanding the impact of each one. Reviewing the fact sheet could also provide helpful background information. However, the primary goal is to get the data into Python, inspect it, and provide initial observations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
