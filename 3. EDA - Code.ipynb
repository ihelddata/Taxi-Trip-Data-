The team is still early into the project, having only just completed an initial plan of action and some early Python coding work.\n\nLuana Rodriquez, the senior data analyst at Automatidata, is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with some EDA and data visualization work for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission project (New York City TLC) to get a general understanding of what taxi ridership looks like. The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.\n\n**The purpose** of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. Your mission is to continue the investigation and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables. \n  \n**The goal** is to clean data set and create a visualization.\n<br/>  \n*This activity has 4 parts:*\n\n**Part 1:** Imports, links, and loading\n\n**Part 2:** Data Exploration\n*   Data cleaning\n\n\n**Part 3:** Building visualizations\n\n**Part 4:** Evaluate and share results\n","metadata":{"id":"rgSbVJvomcVa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PACE: Plan \n\n1. Identify any outliers:\n\n\n*   What methods are best for identifying outliers?\n  * Use numpy functions to investigate the `mean()` and `median()` of the data and understand range of data values\n  * Use a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the data\n  * Use histograms to visualize the distribution of the data\n*   How do you make the decision to keep or exclude outliers from any future models?\n  * There are three main options for dealing with outliers: keeping them as they are, deleting them, or reassigning them. Whether you keep outliers as they are, delete them, or reassign values is a decision that you make taking into account the nature of the outlying data and the assumptions of the model you are building. To help you make the decision, you can start with these general guidelines:\n\n      * Delete them: If you are sure the outliers are mistakes, typos, or errors and the dataset will be used for modeling or machine learning, then you are more likely to decide to delete outliers. Of the three choices, you’ll use this one the least.\n      * Reassign them: If the dataset is small and/or the data will be used for modeling or machine learning, you are more likely to choose a path of deriving new values to replace the outlier values.\n      * Leave them: For a dataset that you plan to do EDA/analysis on and nothing else, or for a dataset you are preparing for a model that is resistant to outliers, it is most likely that you are going to leave them in.\n","metadata":{"id":"xKLZJUqMx8GE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Task 1.
