Their client, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), has hired the Automatidata team for its reputation in helping their clients develop data-based solutions.\n\nThe team is still in the early stages of the project. Previously, you were asked to complete a project proposal by your supervisor, DeShawn Washington. You have received notice that your project proposal has been approved and that New York City TLC has given the Automatidata team access to their data. To get clear insights, New York TLC's data must be analyzed, key variables identified, and the dataset ensured it is ready for analysis.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Inspect and analyze data\n\nIn this activity, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. This activity will help ensure the information is:\n\n1. Ready to answer questions and yield insights\n2. Ready for visualizations\n3. Ready for future hypothesis testing and statistical methods\n\n**The purpose** of this project is to investigate and understand the data provided.\n\n**The goal** is to use a dataframe constructed within Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform team members of your findings.\n\n*This activity has three parts:*\n\n**Part 1:** Understand the situation\n- Prepare to understand and organize the provided taxi cab dataset and information.\n\n**Part 2:** Understand the data\n- Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.\n- Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps.\n\n**Part 3:** Understand the variables\n- Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.\n\nFollow the instructions and answer the following questions to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an Executive Summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.\n\nBe sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Understand the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/yellow-taxi-trip-data-2017/C2_2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv')\n\nprint(\"done\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-12T09:13:02.510426Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-12T09:13:02.510841Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.383505Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-12T09:13:02.510806Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.380606Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head(10)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.384265Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.384656Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.384465Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.384489Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.387036Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.388199Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.387912Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-12T09:13:04.387948Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Dtypes are non-numeric.
